# Preface

Most books tend to be bloated with words for my taste. Things could be said simply & in shorter lengths, I often like to think to myself.  

But then, I haven't read enough books, because "most books tend to be bloated for my taste". So, maybe I don't even know how most books are.  

In recent past though it has become clearer why so many words are needed.
Books are very different from a one-on-one communication, you know little about your reader.  

It has to be written for many different types of minds & has to do a good job at capturing things in one go, I believe.

But what are my beliefs worth? Whatever is true is true and whatever is false is false, regardless of my beliefs.  
The age of science has no scope for beliefs, right?  

But not everything is known for sure. There still are "unknowns" in the world. Hence, there's scope for beliefs. But are all beliefs made equal?  
Are the beliefs of "hollow earth", "multple earths in multiverses" and "sun is inhabited by fire people" all equal?  

It seems some beliefs are more self-contradictory than others. That is the premise for most things that are going to follow. That is what "critical thinking" and "being logical" mean, in my opinion. That is what differentiates reasonable from un-reasonable (or less reasonable).

Science is where things can be proved and verified. But philosophy seems to be where things can't be experimentally/empirically verified, yet can be sorted in the order of reasonability.

Philosophy or Science, whatever you call it, the things to hold on to is "uncharted territories".   
*David Eagleman would call it possibilianism [[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LENqnjZGX0A).*

> Some ways are better than others while dealing with the unknown.

The contradictions happen when two assertions made are impossible to be true simultaneously, given the constraints/axioms. Sometimes it's the axioms that are faulty, sometimes the constraints aren't correctly assumed. In those cases, those axioms must be stated (and if not verifiable, to be considered beliefs) excplicitly. Eventually, the law of noncontradiction holds.
