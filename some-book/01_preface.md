# Preface

Most books tend to be bloated with words for my taste. Things could be said simply & in shorter lengths, I often to think myself.  
But then, I haven't read enough books, because "most books tend to be bloated for my taste".
So, maybe I don't even know how most books are.  
In recent past though it has become clearer why so many words are needed.
Books are very different from a one-on-one communication, you know little about your reader.  
It has to be written for many different types of minds & has to do a good job at capturing things in one go, I believe.
